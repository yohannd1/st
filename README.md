# st

A fork of the [suckless terminal (st)](https://st.suckless.org/) with my
options. Also a fork of [LukeSmithxyz's own st fork](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st).

There's not much to this. :)

Oh yeah, there's a barely thrown-together `PKGBUILD` that uses the local
source, if you're into that.

## features/patches (inherited from luke's fork)

* **follow urls** by pressing `alt-l`
* **copy urls** in the same way with `alt-y`
* **copy the output of commands** with `alt-o`

* Compatibility with `Xresources` and `pywal` for dynamic colors.

* Default [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colors otherwise.

* Transparency/alpha, which is also adjustable from your `Xresources`.

* Default font is system "mono" at 14pt, meaning the font will match your
  system font.

* Boxdraw

* Ligatures

* font2
